![Animation of Distributor plugin](https://yeemachine.github.io/distributor/Cover_anim.gif)

A lightweight plugin for Figma that spaces elements evenly by exact pixel measurements.
 
You can space items vertically or horizontally from their edges or their centers. Alignment options also let you choose which side the items are distributed towards. Elements are repositioned based on their bounding boxes, so the plugin works on rotated objects as well.
